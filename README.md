# BeHere
BeHere is an application that encourages connectivity in real-world locations through in-person events. The main user-interface is an interactive map on which upcoming events are overlayed. Users or groups can post time-sensitive events to a map, which other users can discover and attend. Furthermore, joining the map enables a group-specific chat in which attendees can talk before, during, or after events.
